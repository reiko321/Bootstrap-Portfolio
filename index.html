                                    <p> My name is Jon and I am an Arizona native. Even though I grew up living in
                                        Arizona, my summers were usually spent visiting my Grandparents in Iowa. During
                                        those trips I would get to see the United States in a way that only Grandma and
                                        Grandpa could show a person. We would often load up the Suburban and the travel
                                        trailer and hit the road. Sometimes going as far as Southern Iowa while other
                                        times travelling across the county seeing National Parks, State Capitols and
                                        other noteworthy locations. <br> <br> During the rest of the year, I was in
                                        Arizona and my Father would make sure I stayed busy and experienced "my best
                                        life." On the Weekends I would go camping either with my Father or with the Boy
                                        Scouts of America and over the course of my teen years I achieved the rank of
                                        Eagle Boy Scout with three palms. The Scouts provided me the opportunity to
                                        travel across Europe one year, and to New Zealand the next. Did you know that
                                        Astronaut Neil Armstrong and President Gerald Ford were both Eagle Scouts? As
                                        were 10 United States Senators and 17 members of the U.S. House of
                                        Representatives (2018). That's pretty good company to me!! <br> <br> <br> <br>

                                    <p>I have known my wife Laurie for 11 years where we first met Online. At the time I
                                        was extremely hesitant to start my dating profile but when she 'winked back' at
                                        me little did I know that my life would be changed forever (and for the
                                        better!!). We married in 2011 and we just welcomed our first child in 2018.
                                        Between work, school, and 'Daddy Duty' I am keeping quite busy in 2019!!

                                        learning about hosting, web design and web security. Presently, I work in the
                                        Information Security Division at GoDaddy as a PKI Associate. I joined this
